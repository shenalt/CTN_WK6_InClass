    <h1>Class 6: Calculate the vote results for NY with Kamala Harris</h1>
    <h2>Goal: Calculate voting percentage and determine which candidate won and by what margin. It should look like this:</h2>
    <code>Kamala Harris won New York with 56.4% of the vote, about 13 points more than Donald Trump, who had 43.6%.</code>
    <h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll need to format the numbers a bit -- there's a powerful tool called <code>.ToFixed()</code> in Javascript you can use to round numbers</li>
        <li>You have all the data needed, but you need to figure out which variables to do and how to calculate it</li>
    </ul>
